# ft_linux

## Description
First project of the Kernel branch ! The purpose is to create a simple LFS that will be used to create your own Linux distribution on which you will work for the next projects.

## Goal
The main goal of this project is to create your own very basic linux distribution. You will have chosen all the software you want and can now add whatever you want more for your own distribution. The will also be used in the KFS projects that come next as your base system.

This distribution will be yours and you will be able to select what is installed in what config and with which version.
